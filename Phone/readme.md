Because EasyOpenCv depends on OpenCV-Repackaged, you will also need to copy [libOpenCvNative.so](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenCV-Repackaged/blob/master/doc/libOpenCvNative.so) from the /doc folder of that repo into the FIRST folder on the USB storage of the Robot Controller (i.e. connect the Robot Controller to your computer with a USB cable, put it into MTP mode, and drag 'n drop the file) .
